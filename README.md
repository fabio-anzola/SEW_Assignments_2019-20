# SEW Assignments for the year 2019/20
This repository is my collection of SEW Assignments.

#### Use this just as a reference and do not copy the code for your personal assignment.
This repository is included in the plagiarism scanners of the professors.

The first 10 assignments are made within the processing IDE and thus use the slightly 
changed java version which is used by the processing IDE.
Also the design-features of processing are used.

All other assignments are made within the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
